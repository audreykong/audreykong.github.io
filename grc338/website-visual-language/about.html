    <p>welcome to our home! MAMAS CAFE was founded by five college girls, inspired to follow the house café trend! we all love making drinks and talking to new people, hence our creation of MAMAS CAFE! please come and visit and look out for our instagram (mambas_house) for pop-ups!</p>

    <p>the name, MAMAS CAFE, is derived from the names of the five girls that live in the house. each letter represents each girl, maky, amber, max, audrey, and stacey! we also have our dog named benz, who is a 7-year-old yorkie who loves to eat and cuddle! we all met freshmen year, and have been close ever since. we enjoy visiting different cafés to try different drinks and cooking together.</p>

    <p>a little bit about each of us:</p>
    <p>maky: art & design major, concentration: graphic design, from san diego</p>
    <p>amber: art & design major, concentration: graphic design, Child Development Minor, from irvine</p>
    <p>max: art & design major, concentration: graphic design, accounting minor, from la</p>
    <p>audrey: graphic communication major, concentration: design reproduction technology, from bay area</p>
